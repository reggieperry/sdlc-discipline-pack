# sdlc-discipline pack

A Gas City pack that runs an SDLC chain — plan, build, test, review, document, finalize — against any rig with a Click/pytest/Python project shape. Five pool agents, zero named sessions, parallel-by-default. Concurrency is bounded by host CPU/RAM and per-account API rate limits, not by named-session serialization.

## Architecture (v2.0)

The chain has five LLM pools and zero named sessions. A story bead enters at the worker pool and exits closed after the finalizer.

```text
kickoff (one-shot)
  └─→ worker pool (max=5)        plan + build + self-audit
        └─→ tester pool (max=3)  pytest + ruff + mypy + 3-round resolution
              ├─[red after 3] back to worker pool
              └─[green]
                   └─→ reviewer pool (max=3)    plan-coverage audit + rule self-audits
                         ├─[blocker] back to worker pool
                         └─[pass]
                              └─→ documenter pool (max=2)  feature doc + push
                                    └─→ finalizer pool (max=2)  PR refresh + auto-merge gate
                                          └─→ closed
```

Total max concurrent sessions per rig: 15. Bead handoffs use `metadata.gc.routed_to` only — never `--assignee` — because the supervisor's default scale-check filters `--unassigned`. The pack's `comparison/v2.0a-stall-record.json` records the regression that motivated this convention.

```

The pack uses Gas City's `overlay/` mechanism to inject `.claude/rules/*.md` and `.claude/settings.json` into each chain agent's working directory at session-spawn time. The discipline rules live in **one place**: `overlay/per-provider/claude/.claude/rules/`. Rigs do not need to track their own copies; they consume the pack's rules via overlay. Rigs that *want* to override a specific rule can ship a same-named file in their own `.claude/rules/` — the workspace-setup propagation step preserves rig-tracked files (rig wins on filename collision). See *How rules reach the agent* below.

The non-worker pools (tester, reviewer, documenter, finalizer) drive single-conversation workflows from their prompt templates. Only the worker walks a multi-step formula because its work has structurally distinct phases inside one session.

## Prerequisites and installation

The pack runs on top of Gas City (the orchestration runtime) against a Python project (the rig). Cold-start install covers four pieces: system tools, Gas City itself, a Gas City workspace, and the pack import.

### 1. System tools

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y git jq tmux build-essential

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install git jq tmux
```

A Go toolchain (1.22+) is needed if installing Gas City from source. `uv` is needed at the rig level for Python dependency management.

### 2. Install Gas City

Gas City ships as a single Go binary, `gc`. Install from source:

```bash
go install github.com/gastownhall/gascity/cmd/gc@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity.git
cd gascity
go build -o ~/.local/bin/gc ./cmd/gc
```

Verify the install:

```bash
gc version    # should print 1.1.1 or newer
gc doctor     # checks system tools, config layout, pack family
```

The doctor command surfaces missing tools (jq, tmux, git) and any config drift; treat its warnings as actionable. See `https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity` for current release notes and platform-specific install variations.

### 3. Initialize a Gas City workspace

A workspace ("city") holds one or more rigs (project directories) plus a shared runtime under `.gc/`. Create one:

```bash
gc init ~/my-city --provider claude
cd ~/my-city
```

`gc init` writes a minimal `city.toml`, a top-level `pack.toml`, the `.gc/` runtime directory, and the standard prompt-template skeletons. Rerun with `--preserve-existing` if bootstrapping over a committed workspace.

### 4. Register the rig (project)

Point the workspace at the project directory that the SDLC chain will operate against. The rig must already be a git repository with a Python toolchain (`pyproject.toml` + `uv`-managed `.venv`).

```bash
gc rig add /path/to/my-project --name my-project
```

`gc rig add` initializes the rig's bead store under `.beads/`, installs agent hooks, and appends a `[[rigs]]` block to the workspace's `city.toml`.

### 5. Install the pack

Two ways to add the pack to the rig.

**Via `gc import add` (recommended).** Pulls the pack from a git remote, caches it under `.gc/`, and writes the import declaration:

```bash
cd ~/my-city
gc import add github.com/<owner>/sdlc-discipline-pack --name sdlc-discipline
```

For a private repo, the runner's git config needs credentials that can clone it (a personal access token via `gh auth login`, an SSH key, or a credential helper).

**Via direct city.toml edit.** Useful for a local-checkout development loop:

```toml
[[rigs]]
name = "my-project"

[rigs.imports]
[rigs.imports.sdlc-discipline]
source = "/path/to/sdlc-discipline-pack"   # or "github.com/<owner>/sdlc-discipline-pack"

# Operating mode (see "Three operating modes" below). The env vars apply
# to the finalizer pool, which owns the merge gate.
[[rigs.patches]]
agent = "finalizer"
[rigs.patches.env]
SDLC_OPEN_PR_DEFAULT = "true"
SDLC_GLANCE_MERGE_DEFAULT = "false"
```

### 6. Reload and verify

```bash
gc reload
gc config explain | grep -E '^Agent:.*sdlc-discipline'
```

The reload picks up the new import. `gc config explain` should list five agents under the rig — worker, tester, reviewer, documenter, and finalizer — each pointing at the pack's prompt templates and configured with the per-pool `max_active_sessions` ceilings (5/3/3/2/2).

### 7. Start the supervisor (first time)

```bash
gc start
```

Brings the city up under the machine-wide supervisor. After this point, beads routed to a pool's template name will spawn fresh sessions on demand and de-scale on idle.

## How rules reach the agent

The pack ships discipline rules and settings via Gas City's `overlay/` mechanism. At session-spawn time, the supervisor materializes `overlay/per-provider/<provider>/...` content into the agent's working directory, then starts the chain agent there. For Claude-Code agents this means `.claude/rules/*.md` and `.claude/settings.json` land at the agent's pre-spawn cwd, where Claude Code's auto-load picks them up.

The worker formula's `workspace-setup` step then creates a per-bead worktree for the actual story work and `cd`s into it. That step propagates the overlay-materialized `.claude/` into the per-bead worktree, conditional on filename absence: only files the rig doesn't already track are populated from the overlay. A rig can override any specific rule by tracking a same-named file in its own `.claude/rules/` — the rig wins, the pack supplies the rest.

This means:

- **Fresh rigs** (a brand-new Python project, an OCaml project being onboarded, a pilot): no `.claude/rules/` content of their own. The pack supplies all 9 rules + `settings.json` via overlay. No tarball, no operator step, no manual extraction.
- **Established rigs** that ship rig-specific rules (e.g., a rig with a project-specific `python.md` style guide): the rig's tracked file wins; the pack fills in the rest.
- **Rule evolution**: the canonical rules live in *one* place — this pack's `overlay/per-provider/claude/.claude/rules/`. Update them here, ship a new pack version, and every rig picks up the change on its next chain run. Rigs don't carry their own copies that drift.

The other agents (tester, reviewer, documenter, finalizer) work directly in their pool-instance work_dirs — the same place the overlay materializes — so they see the rules without needing the propagation step. Only the worker creates a separate per-bead worktree (for crash-recovery resumability) and therefore needs the propagation logic.

## Three operating modes

Two env vars, set per-rig in `city.toml` via a patch on the finalizer agent, drive the three common scenarios.

### Mode A — Solo, no PR

Branch is pushed; story closes on success without a PR.

```toml
[[rigs.patches]]
agent = "finalizer"
[rigs.patches.env]
SDLC_OPEN_PR_DEFAULT = "false"
```

### Mode B — Team, PR for human review

Branch is pushed, PR is opened with a story-referencing body, glance-merge is off so a human approves the merge.

```toml
[[rigs.patches]]
agent = "finalizer"
[rigs.patches.env]
SDLC_OPEN_PR_DEFAULT = "true"
SDLC_GLANCE_MERGE_DEFAULT = "false"
```

### Mode C — Solo, PR + auto-merge

Branch is pushed, PR is opened, the glance rubric runs, and the finalizer auto-merges if the rubric passes.

```toml
[[rigs.patches]]
agent = "finalizer"
[rigs.patches.env]
SDLC_OPEN_PR_DEFAULT = "true"
SDLC_GLANCE_MERGE_DEFAULT = "true"
```

The env vars are read by the finalizer pool, which owns the merge gate. Until v1.x, the documenter held this responsibility — that boundary moved in v2.0.

## Per-story overrides

The env var is the rig's default. Any story bead can override either toggle via metadata at story creation:

```bash
bd create "csv2json: ..." \
  --description "..." \
  --set-metadata open_pr=true \
  --set-metadata glance_merge=false
```

Useful when a normally-glance-merged rig has a sensitive story that warrants human review, or when a no-PR rig wants visibility on one particular change.

## The glance rubric

Seven binary checks (`assets/scripts/sdlc-glance-rubric.sh`):

| ID | Check |
|---|---|
| R1 | `metadata.test_status == "green"` |
| R2 | `metadata.review_verdict == "pass"` |
| R3 | All CI checks on the PR are green (auto-pass when no CI) |
| R4 | Diff size ≤ 200 LOC across ≤ 10 files |
| R5 | No undeclared sensitive-file edits |
| R6 | All acceptance criteria are addressed per the review |
| R7 | PR is `mergeable: CLEAN` |

R4's thresholds are tunable: `SDLC_GLANCE_LOC_MAX` (default 200), `SDLC_GLANCE_FILES_MAX` (default 10).

## Cost tracking

Each pool agent records `<phase>.session_id` and `<phase>.started_at` at start, `<phase>.completed_at` at end, on the story bead's metadata. The `sdlc-cost-rollup` order watches for `bead.closed` events and appends a row to `<city>/cost_history.csv`:

```csv
timestamp,story_id,phase,session_id,duration_seconds,cost_usd,rig
```

Today, `cost_usd` is left as `0` because Gas City does not yet expose per-session token usage in a queryable form. Duration captures the time signal; cost can be filled in later when usage data becomes available, or estimated from duration × per-model rate.

Three query scripts:

```bash
commands/cost-story/run.sh <story_id>          # per-phase breakdown for one story
commands/cost-session/run.sh --since 1h        # time-window summary
commands/cost-stories/run.sh --rig csv2json    # cross-story summary, optionally filtered
```

## Authoring stories

```bash
cd <rig>
bash commands/story-new/run.sh "csv2json: add a --quiet flag"
```

Opens `$EDITOR` on a prefilled markdown template with the entry-point format (Outcome / Acceptance / Scope / Sensitive / Notes). After save, prompts for `open_pr` and `base_branch` (with rig env defaults). Runs `bd create` with the description + metadata; echoes the new bead ID.

## Running the chain

After authoring a story, kick off the SDLC pipeline. Two paths.

**Recommended: the kickoff script.** Runs four `bd` commands locally and exits in under a second.

```bash
cd <rig>
bash commands/kickoff/run.sh <bead_id>
```

The script sets `gc.routed_to=<rig>/sdlc-discipline.worker` on the story bead, stamps `sdlc_run_started`, leaves a kickoff note, and exits. The supervisor's pool reconciler spawns a fresh worker on its next tick and the chain proceeds.

**Alternative: the formula-driven kickoff.** Spawns a fresh Claude Code session that runs the same four `bd` commands inside `mol-sdlc.toml`'s kickoff step. Higher latency (~60–120s) and material RAM pressure under concurrent loads (each kickoff is ~350 MB), but creates a wisp molecule bead in the bead store for graph-tracking purposes.

```bash
gc sling <rig>/<provider> mol-sdlc --formula --var story_id=<bead_id>
```

Once the bead is routed, both paths converge: the worker's pool reconciler spawns a fresh worker, which walks the six-step `mol-sdlc-work` formula (load-context, plan, workspace-setup, implement, self-audit, submit-and-exit) and routes the bead to the tester pool. Each subsequent pool runs a single-conversation handoff and routes onward via `gc.routed_to` — never `--assignee`.

## Watching the chain

```bash
bash commands/watch/run.sh <bead_id>
```

Colorized one-line-per-phase monitor. Prints a line on each meaningful state transition; exits when the story closes or after 30 minutes.

For a richer multi-pane view (events stream + bead metadata + watch + artifacts):

```bash
bash commands/demo/run.sh <bead_id>
```

Four-pane tmux layout. Edit the `CITY` and `RIG` paths at the top of the script for your setup, or set `SDLC_DEMO_CITY` / `SDLC_DEMO_RIG` env vars.

## Project assumptions

The agent prompts assume a Python project with:

- a `tests/` directory and `uv run pytest tests/ -v` as the test command
- Click for CLI surface (used in some prompt examples)
- standard `git` workflow (branch + commit + push)

Adapting to a different stack is mostly a prompt-template edit (test command, language conventions). The formulas, scripts, and routing convention are stack-agnostic.

## Versioning

Schema 2. Pack version follows semver:

- **major** — breaking change to env-var names, formula names, agent names, or prompt protocol
- **minor** — new agents, formulas, or scripts; new env vars with safe defaults
- **patch** — bug fixes, prompt clarifications, doc updates

### Version history

- **v2.0** — five-pool polecat architecture, zero named sessions; documenter split into documenter (docs only) + finalizer (PR refresh + auto-merge gate); tester split out of worker for fresh-context test resolution; SDLC_*_DEFAULT env vars moved from documenter to finalizer.
- **v1.3** — five named-session phase agents (planner, implementor, tester, reviewer, documenter) with the gascity#1893 kickoff workaround; portable settings.json shipped in the pack.
- See `comparison/` for v1.3 baseline metrics, the v2.0a interim stall record, and replayable story bodies for cross-version comparison.
